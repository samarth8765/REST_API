# REST API
- Representational State Transfer API
- It is a design pattern for creating web services that are scalable, flexible, and maintainable. RESTful services are built on top of HTTP, the protocol used for transferring data on the web, and they use standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. to perform operations on resources identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

- The main idea behind REST is to use the HTTP protocol in a way that is consistent with its design principles, such as statelessness, cache ability, and layered architecture. RESTful services expose resources as a set of URLs that clients can access using HTTP methods. Clients can perform operations on these resources by sending HTTP requests to the server, which then responds with an HTTP response that includes the requested data or indicates an error.

- Overall, REST provides a standardized way of building web services that can be easily consumed by other applications and platforms, making it a popular choice for building APIs and web services.

- In RESTFUL API'S 
    - Create - Post
    - Read - Get
    - Update - Put, Patch
    - Delete - Delete
- A user will perform different operations on an API but in restful API endpoint doesn't change for different operation.
